# kerr_black_hole

This project allows you to trace the null geodesics of Kerr spacetime, in other words, it allows you to ray trace a spinning black hole. The code is written in python and operates in multiple processes to increase the efficiency.

## Run

The executable file is ./src/tracer.py, use the -h or --help switches to view the usage options.

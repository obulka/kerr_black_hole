# kerr_black_hole

This project allows you to trace the null geodesics of Kerr spacetime, in other words, it allows you to ray trace a spinning black hole. The code is written in python and operates in multiple processes to increase the efficiency.

## Setup

This project is managed via pipenv. To setup the project, traverse to this directory and run:

    pipenv shell
    pipenv install

## Run

The executable file is `./src/tracer.py`, use the `-h` or `--help` switches to view the usage options.
